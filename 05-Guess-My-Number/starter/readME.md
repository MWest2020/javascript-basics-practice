# Guess my number
Classic game that makes you guess a number between 1 and 20
## General Info

The aim for this little game is just having some fun and to work with classes in JavaScript. The HTML and CSS were 
provided by Jonas Schmedtman - this was a tutorial from his Udemy JavaScript Course. I skipped the tutorial and started coding from the starter files. 

I am looking to give it a more retro feeling and will use http://andersevenrud.github.io/shell/ as inspiration. 

## Technologies

* HTML 5   
* CSS 3
* JavaScript ES6 


The game is started by downloading all the files and by running the index.html file. Any modern browser should do. Internet Explorer 
does not support arrow functions though.

### Note:

Future update may include difficulty modes, average game score and total games played, and game records stored in local storage.
